# HousingPricePrediction

Title of Project: Housing Price Prediction 
Objective/Aim: To Predict the Price of a house from Prior given features by using a machine learning model to train a given data set.

Technical Details: I have created a model to predict the Price of a house. 
This model has been developed using Machine Learningâ€™s Supervised Learning concept and it uses ML Models for predicting the Price of a house. 
I have maintained data in .CSV format with 13 independent variables and 1 dependent variable.

Innovativeness & Usefulness: It has an ability to predict value very accurately with minimum error rate. It can be used in Real Estate Business as it can overcome the possibility of any human error. 
This model can save lot of money for people as this includes all the basic features we consider while buying a house.

Current Status of Development: This Model is completed in all senses and it is fully functional, considering the data we have provided for training as well as for testing. It can also provide good results with new Data sets also.
